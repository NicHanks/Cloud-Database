# The Goal

The Goal of this project is to interact with a cloud database. That means inserting, modifying, deleting, and retrieving (or quering) in a data table. 

# Overview

The software I've written has been done in swiftui ie ios app, and is uploaded to google firebase as well as git.

# Cloud Database

The cloud data base I am using is a tried and true google service. It is easily connected to google analytics which makes it easy to see and analysis the traffic and data of the project(s). 

# Development Environment

I've been using xcode for the app/swiftui and as well as vs code for documentation and everything else. 
I've been using the firebase library sdk so that it can more easily work with python and all of the other things. 

# Useful Websites

- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [Docuentation:](https://www.swift.org/documentation/package-manager/)

# Future Work

- Item 1: Manipulate the data base a little bit more and fine a way to bring it over to android. (Find a way to make itcross-platform. )
